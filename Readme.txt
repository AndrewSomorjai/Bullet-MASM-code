The program is as is, no warranty although feel free to look through the esoteric 
mess of using assembler in making a simple game. It has lots of bugs but it runs somewhat.
I will never update this and this is the end of the repo.


Instructions to play:

Use the mouse to move the "gun" and use the left button to fire a "bullet". 
The collision detection is not functional though. Can't remember why since I
haven't really looked at this since 2005.

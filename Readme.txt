The program is as is, no warranty although feel free to look through the esoteric 
mess of using assembler in making a simple game. It has lots of bugs but it runs somewhat.
I will never update this and this is the end of the repo.


Instructions to play:

Use the mouse to move the "gun" and use the left button to fire a "bullet". 
Press ESC to end. The game might crash after a few minutes, don't know why 
though.

The collision detection is not functional, can't remember why since I
last looked at this program in 2005.
